# Tic-tac-toe

This is a project done following [this real python tutorial.](https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-ai-python/)
The idea is to use it for learning a little of model development and object oriented
programming. Use it as a place for doing experiments with new things I want to learn
and finally doing other games similar to this to continue practicing.
